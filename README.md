<p> I am a Junior at Mizzou looking to graduate in Fall 2022. My plan after that is too get a job in the KC metro area and really pursue my career in coding and lifting </p>
<br>
<p> My 5 year plan consists of opening my own gym and investing into some property to generate some passive income. I want to also invests into my esports org and do that full time in the future </p>
<br>
<p> If you are interested in my esports organization please follow @SiKedGG on twitter to stay up to date.</p>
<br>
<p> I am also training to become a personal trainer and build my own brand </p>
<br>
<p> I want to generate passive income so I can stay comfortable and live a life where I follow my dreams </p>
<br>
<p> Family is super important to me so I would like to stay close and be in a position to take care of them </p>
